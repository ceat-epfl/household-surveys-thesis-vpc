# Structured questionnaires used in household surveys in Abidjan and in Nairobi.

Contains two XLS files formatting the household surveys that were conducted in four informal settlements (two in Abidjan, two in Nairobi), in the context of my PhD thesis. The XLS files can be imported directly into KoboToolbox. They were implemented using the mobile application KoboCollect.
